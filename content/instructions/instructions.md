1. Spawn in the World
Once the game loads, you'll spawn in a random location within your world. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with your surroundings.

2. Gather Basic Materials
Your first task is to gather basic materials to craft tools and other items. Begin by punching trees to collect wood. Hold down the left mouse button while facing a tree trunk to break it into Log blocks. [punching tree screenshot]

3. Craft a Crafting Table
Open your inventory by pressing the "E" key. Use the Logs you've collected to craft a crafting table. To do this, place some Logs in one slot in the 2x2 crafting grid to create wooden planks, then arrange four wooden planks in a square pattern to craft a crafting table.

4. Place the Crafting Table
Once you've crafted a crafting table, place it on the ground by selecting it in your hotbar and right-clicking on the ground where you want to place it.

5. Craft Wooden Tools
With your crafting table placed, open it by right-clicking on it. Use the wooden planks you've crafted to create wooden tools, including a wooden pickaxe, axe, and shovel. These tools will allow you to gather more resources efficiently. To craft a pickaxe, place three wooden planks in a horizontal line across the top row and place two sticks in the bottom two spaces of the middle column. [wooden pickaxe recipe screenshot]

6. Mine Stone
To progress to stronger tools, you'll need to start mining! Look for exposed stone on the surface or dig into the sides of cliffs to find it. Use your wooden pickaxe to mine stone blocks. You'll need at least three blocks of cobblestone.

7. Craft Stone Tools
With your cobblestone blocks collected, return to your crafting table and craft stone tools. These tools are more durable and efficient than wooden tools and will help you progress further in the game. The pattern for crafting a stone pickaxe is the same as a wooden pickaxe, but the wooden planks are replaced by cobblestone. [cobblestone pickaxe recipe screenshot]

8. Locate a Cave or Mine
Exploring your world, you'll come across natural formations such as caves or diggable areas leading underground. These are great places to find valuable resources like iron and diamonds.

9. Mine for Iron Ore
Within caves or underground mines, look for grayish blocks with orange spots on them. These are iron ore blocks. Use your stone pickaxe to mine them. Collect enough iron ore to smelt into iron ingots. You will need at least 3 for an iron pickaxe. If you happen to find some coal ore on your journey, grab some of that too! It’ll make your smelting process later more efficient.

10. Craft and Place a Furnace
To smelt iron ore into iron ingots, you'll need to craft a furnace. Open your crafting table and place cobblestone blocks in a square pattern, leaving the center square empty. This will create a furnace. Take the furnace from the crafting table and place it on the ground by right-clicking. [furnace recipe screenshot]

11. Smelt Iron Ore
Once you've placed the furnace, interact with it by right-clicking on it. Place the iron ore in the top slot of the furnace and a fuel source (such as coal or wood) in the bottom slot. Wait for the iron ore to smelt into iron ingots. [iron smelting screenshot]

12. Craft an Iron Pickaxe
Once you have at least three iron ingots, return to your crafting table and craft an iron pickaxe. The pattern for crafting an iron pickaxe is the same as a wooden pickaxe, but the wooden planks are replaced by iron ingots. [iron pickaxe recipe screenshot]

13. Mine for Diamonds
With your iron pickaxe, explore deeper into caves or mines to find diamond ore blocks. These ore blocks have distinctive blue spots on them.

14. Mine Diamond Ore
Use your iron pickaxe to mine the diamond ore blocks. Each block will drop a diamond. Get at least three! [diamond ore screenshot]

15. Craft a Diamond Pickaxe
Return to your crafting table and craft a diamond pickaxe using three diamonds and two sticks. The pattern for crafting a diamond pickaxe is the same as a wooden pickaxe, but the wooden planks are replaced by diamonds. [diamond pickaxe recipe screenshot]

Congratulations, you now have a powerful tool capable of mining even the toughest materials in Minecraft! [screenshot of mining ancient debris, hinting to something even more powerful…]
