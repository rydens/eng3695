Minecraft is the most popular sandbox video game of all time. It offers players virtually infinite worlds to play in, however they desire. You can build with infinite resources in Creative mode, or gather materials and fight mobs in Survival mode. 

The basic controls are as follows:
- Look around using your mouse
- Move around using W, A, S, D
- Jump with Space Bar
- Mine blocks with Left Click
- Place and interact with blocks using Right Click
- Open your inventory with E
- Close any GUIs (inventory, chest, crafting table, etc) or pause the game with Esc
- Choose which item you have currently equipped in your hotbar by using the number keys 1-9 or scrolling on your mouse

In Survival mode, the player has to face the threat of monsters and hunger, while gathering food to survive and materials to build shelter and craft weapons and tools with. This guide will cover the steps necessary to obtaining the iconic mining tool, the Diamond Pickaxe.
