# On the Surface
## Wood
Wood is one of the most basic building materials in *Minecraft*. It's obtained by punching or chopping down trees, and it can be crafted into wooden planks, which are essential for crafting tools, crafting tables, and various other items. Wood is the starting point for any crafting adventure in Minecraft. [picture of *Minecraft* tree]

## Sticks
Sticks are simple yet essential crafting materials in Minecraft. They are crafted from wooden planks and are used as handles for tools, weapons, and various other items. Sticks are required for crafting the diamond pickaxe, as they form the handles of the pickaxe along with the diamond gemstones. They're an integral part of many crafting recipes throughout the game.

# Underground
## Stone
Stone is a common material found underground in Minecraft. It's obtained by mining stone blocks with a wooden or better pickaxe. Stone is the next step up from wood and is used to craft more durable tools and structures. Stone tools are an improvement over wooden tools, offering increased efficiency and durability.

## Iron Ore
Iron ore is a valuable resource found deep underground in Minecraft. It appears as grayish blocks with orange spots on them. Iron ore can only be mined with a stone or better pickaxe. When smelted in a furnace, iron ore yields iron ingots, which are essential for crafting stronger tools, armor, and other useful items.

## Iron Ingot
Iron ingots are obtained by smelting iron ore in a furnace. They are versatile materials used in crafting various tools, weapons, armor, and decorative blocks. Iron ingots are stronger and more durable than stone, making them an essential component for progressing in Minecraft.

## Coal
Coal is a valuable resource used as a fuel source in furnaces and as an ingredient for crafting torches. It's commonly found underground in coal ore blocks and can be mined with any pickaxe. When placed in a furnace, coal can smelt up to eight items, making it an essential material for smelting ores and cooking food.

## Diamond Ore
Diamond ore is one of the rarest and most valuable resources in Minecraft. It appears as grayish blocks with blue spots on them and is found deep underground at lower levels. Diamond ore can only be mined with an iron or better pickaxe. When mined, diamond ore drops diamonds, which are used to craft some of the strongest tools, weapons, and armor in the game.
